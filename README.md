# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Challenge
According to the data, the most successful campaigns were created from May-July but this does not inform us of the probability a campaign will be successful due to the need for analyis by percentage.																		

The number of successful campaigns that  were created from November-December are year lows; showing s possilbe seasonal effect but we would need to show mulitple years of data to show a cyclical pattern. 																				

When goals for fundraising are $4999 and under, the probability a campaign will succeed are at it's highest but we would need a larger sample size from campaign with goals of above $14999.
